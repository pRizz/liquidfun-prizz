# liquidfun-prizz
Provides Google's liquidfun library as an npm package

The release is obtained from `http://google.github.io/liquidfun/testbed/liquidfun.js`

# Usage

At the moment, this package must be used the old-school way in a web environment:

```html
<script src="liquidfun.js"></script>
```

## TODO

Refactor the liquidfun library to expose all necessary properties, such as `b2Vec2`, etc.
